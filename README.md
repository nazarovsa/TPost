##Sample
You can find working sample in *_Samples/TPost.Host.Sample* [folder](https://github.com/nazarovsa/TPost/tree/main/_Samples/TPost.WebHost.Sample).
This sample crawling jokes from two sites and publishing them into console. As you can see it just implements two crawlers and registering them in host.  
I have real project, which works like that and it posts jokes into [@cringedot](https://t.me/cringedot) telegram channel.
